# LipNet
The lip-reading project requires several key components to function effectively. The system must support various video formats and resolutions for input processing and include advanced algorithms for isolating and analysing lip movements. Real-time processing capabilities are essential for live transcription and hands-free interaction. The project requires robust machine learning models trained to recognize and interpret lip movements accurately, with a focus on high word accuracy and performance. A user-friendly interface is necessary for ease of interaction, and the system must be adaptable to different users and environments. Additionally, the project should address challenges such as variability in lip movements and background noise, employing strategies like data augmentation and model refinement. Integration with assistive technologies, security systems, and hands-free applications will also be a critical aspect of the project.
